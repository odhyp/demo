  <p>Before you start writing your blog post, make sure you have a clear understanding of your target audience. To do so, take the following steps.</p>
<h2 id="ask-yourself-exploratory-questions">Ask yourself exploratory questions</h2>
<p>To discover your audience, ask questions like: Who are they? Are they like me, or do I know someone like them? What do they want to know about? What will resonate with them?</p>
<p>Jot down your notes in a notepad or a document. This is the time to brainstorm audience attributes from scratch, no matter how out of left field they may feel. You should also think about your audience&rsquo;s age, background, goals, and challenges at this stage.</p>
<h2 id="carry-out-market-research">Carry out market research.</h2>
<p>Doing market research sounds like a big task, but in truth, it can be as simple as accessing a social media platform and browsing user and blog profiles that match with your potential audience.</p>
<p>Use market research tools to begin uncovering more specific information about your audience — or to confirm a hunch or a piece of information you already knew. For instance, if you wanted to create a blog about work-from-home hacks, you can make the reasonable assumption that your audience will be mostly Gen Zers and Millennials. But it’s important to confirm this information through research.</p>
<h2 id="create-formal-buyer-personas">Create formal buyer personas</h2>
<p>Once you’ve brainstormed and carried out market research, it’s time to create formal buyer personas. It’s important because what you know about your buyer personas and their interests will inform the brainstorming process for blog posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buyer personas aren’t just for direct marketing. They can be a handy way to keep a human in mind while you’re writing. If you’ve got other marketing or sales teams handy, coordinate your personas,&rdquo; says Curtis del Principe, user acquisition manager at HubSpot. &ldquo;Chances are that your existing customers are exactly the kind of people you want to attract with your writing in the first place. Your sales and service teams can also have great insight into these people’s needs and pain points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For instance, if your readers are Millennials looking to start a business, you probably don&rsquo;t need to provide them with information about getting started on social media — most of them already have that down.</p>
<p>You might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have buyer personas in place for your business? Here are a few resources to help you get started:</p>
