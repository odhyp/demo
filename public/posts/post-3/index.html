  <p>What better way to draw inspiration than to look at your well-established competition?</p>
<p>It’s worth taking a look at popular, highly reviewed blogs because their strategy and execution is what got them to grow in credibility. The purpose of doing this isn’t to copy these elements, but to gain better insight into what readers appreciate in a quality blog.</p>
<p>When you find a competitor’s blog, take the following steps:</p>
<h2 id="determine-whether-theyre-actually-a-direct-competitor">Determine whether they’re actually a direct competitor.</h2>
<p>A blog’s audience, niche, and specific slant determine whether they&rsquo;re actually your competitor. But the most important of these is their audience. If they serve a completely different public than you, then they’re likely not a competitor. That is why it’s important to define your buyer personas before taking other steps in the blog creation process.</p>
<h2 id="look-at-the-blogs-branding-color-palette-and-theme">Look at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme.</h2>
<p>Once you determine that they’re your competitor, it’s time to take note of their techniques so that you can capture a similar readership. Colors and themes play a huge role in whether you seem like part of a niche — for instance, a blog about eco-friendly products should likely use earthy tones instead of bright, unnatural colors such as neon yellow or pink.</p>
<h2 id="analyze-the-tone-and-writing-style-of-the-competition">Analyze the tone and writing style of the competition.</h2>
<p>Take note of your competition’s copywriting. Is it something you feel like you can successfully emulate? Does it ring true to the type of blog you’d like to create? What do readers most respond to? For most, creating a tech blog might be an excellent idea, but if journalistic, review-based writing doesn’t work for you, then that might not be a good fit. Be aware of what you can feasibly execute or hire freelance writers.</p>
